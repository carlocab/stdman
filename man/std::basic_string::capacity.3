.SH NAME
std::basic_string::capacity \- std::basic_string::capacity

.SH Synopsis
   size_type capacity() const;                     \fI(until C++11)\fP
   size_type capacity() const noexcept;            \fI(since C++11)\fP
                                                   \fI(until C++20)\fP
   constexpr size_type capacity() const noexcept;  \fI(since C++20)\fP

   Returns the number of characters that the string has currently allocated space for.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   Capacity of the currently allocated storage, i.e. the storage available for storing
   elements.

.SH Complexity

   Constant

.SH Notes

   Memory locations obtained from the allocator but not available for storing any
   element are not counted in the allocated storage. Note that the null terminator is
   not an element of the basic_string.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <string>

 void show_capacity(std::string const& s)
 {
     std::cout << "'" << s << "' has capacity " << s.capacity() << ".\\n";
 }

 int main()
 {
     std::string s{"Exemplar"};
     show_capacity(s);

     s += " is an example string.";
     show_capacity(s);
 }

.SH Possible output:

 'Exemplar' has capacity 15.
 'Exemplar is an example string.' has capacity 30.
