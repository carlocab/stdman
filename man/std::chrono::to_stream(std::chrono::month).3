.SH Synopsis
   template <class CharT, class Traits>

   std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>&                                     \fI(since C++20)\fP

   to_stream(std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os, const CharT* fmt,
   const std::chrono::month& m);

   Outputs m to the stream os, formatted according to the null-terminated format string
   fmt.

  Format string

   The format string consists of zero or more conversion specifiers and ordinary
   characters. All ordinary characters, excluding the terminating null character, are
   written into the output stream without modification. Each unmodified conversion
   specifier begins with a % character followed by a character that determines the
   behavior of the specifier. Some conversion specifiers have a modified form in which
   an E or O modifier character is inserted after the % character. Each conversion
   specifier is replaced by appropriate characters in the output as described below.

   A character sequence in the format string that begins with a % but does not match
   one of the format specifiers below is interpreted as ordinary characters.

   The following format specifiers are available:

   Conversion                               Explanation
   specifier
       %%     Writes a literal % character.
       %n     Writes a newline character.
       %t     Writes a horizontal tab character.
                                          Month
       %b     Writes the locale's abbreviated month name.
       %h
       %B     Writes the locale's full month name.
              Writes the month as a decimal number (January is 01). If the result is a
       %m     single digit, it is prefixed with 0.
      %Om
              The modified command %Om writes the locale's alternative representation.

   The following specifiers are recognized, but will cause std::ios_base::failbit to be
   set in os:

   Conversion                               Explanation
   specifier
                                           Year

              single digit it is prefixed by 0.
       %Y     Writes the year as a decimal number. If the result is less than four
              digits it is left-padded with 0 to four digits.

                                 ISO 8601 week-based year
   In ISO 8601 weeks begin with Monday and the first week of the year must satisfy the
   following requirements:

     * Includes January 4
     * Includes first Thursday of the year

              the result is a single digit it is prefixed by 0.

       %j     the result is less than three digits, it is left-padded with 0 to three
              digits.
              Writes the week number of the year as a decimal number. The first Sunday
              of the year is the first day of week 01. Days of the same year prior to
       %U     that are in week 00. If the result is a single digit, it is prefixed
      %OU     with 0.

              Writes the week number of the year as a decimal number. The first Monday
              of the year is the first day of week 01. Days of the same year prior to
       %W     that are in week 00. If the result is a single digit, it is prefixed
      %OW     with 0.

              If the precision of the input cannot be exactly represented with
       %S     seconds, then the format is a decimal floating point number with a fixed
      %OS     format and a precision matching that of the precision of the input (or
              to a microseconds precision if the conversion to floating point decimal
              seconds cannot be made within 18 fractional digits). The character for
              the decimal point is localized according to the locale.

              The modified command %OS writes the locale's alternative representation.
       %p     Writes the locale's equivalent of the AM/PM designations associated with
              a 12-hour clock.

       %z     refers to 4 hours 30 minutes behind UTC. If the offset is zero, +0000 is
      %Ez     used.
      %Oz
