.SH Synopsis
   atomic_ref() = delete;                        \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP
   explicit atomic_ref( T& obj );                \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP
   atomic_ref( const atomic_ref& ref ) noexcept; \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Constructs a new atomic_ref object.

   1) The default constructor is deleted; atomic_ref is not DefaultConstructible.
   2) Constructs an atomic_ref object referencing the object obj. The behavior is
   undefined if obj is not aligned to required_alignment.
   3) Constructs an atomic_ref object referencing the object referenced by ref.

   ref - another atomic_ref object to copy from
