   size_type find_last_not_of( const basic_string& str, size_type pos \fB(1)\fP
   = npos ) const;
   size_type find_last_not_of( const CharT* s, size_type pos,         \fB(2)\fP

   size_type find_last_not_of( const T& t, size_type pos = npos )     \fB(5)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   const;

   Finds the last character equal to none of the characters in the given character
   sequence. The search considers only the interval [0; pos]. If the character is not
   present in the interval, npos will be returned.

   1) Finds the last character equal to none of characters in str.
   2) Finds the last character equal to none of characters in the first count
   characters of the character string pointed to by s. s can include null characters.
   3) Finds the last character equal to none of characters in character string pointed
   to by s. The length of the string is determined by the first null character.
   4) Finds the last character not equal to ch.
   5) Implicitly converts t to a string view sv as if by std::basic_string_view<CharT,
   Traits> sv = t;, then finds the last character equal to none of characters in sv.
   This overload only participates in overload resolution if
   std::is_convertible_v<const T&, std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits>> is true and
   std::is_convertible_v<const T&, const CharT*> is false.

   In all cases, equality is checked by calling Traits::eq.

.SH Parameters

   str   - string identifying characters to search for
   pos   - position at which to begin searching
   count - length of character string identifying characters to search for
   s     - pointer to a character string identifying characters to search fo
   ch    - character identifying characters to search for
   t     - object (convertible to std::basic_string_view) identifying characters to
           search for

.SH Return value

   Position of the found character or npos if no such character is found.
