std::ranges::swap \- std::ranges::swap

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <concepts>
   inline namespace /* unspecified */ {

       inline constexpr /* unspecified */ swap = /*        \fI(since C++20)\fP
   unspecified */;                                         (customization point object)

   }
   Call signature
   template< class T, class U >

       requires /* see below */

   constexpr void swap(T&& t, U&& u) noexcept(/* see
   below */);

   Exchanges the values referenced by t and u.

   A call to ranges::swap is equivalent to:

   1) (void)swap(std::forward<T>(t), std::forward<U>(u)), if that expression is valid,
   where the overload resolution is performed with the following candidates:

     * template<class T> void swap(T&, T&) = delete;
     * template<class T, std::size_t N> void swap(T(&)[N], T(&)[N]) = delete;
     * any declarations of swap found by argument-dependent lookup.

   If the function selected by overload resolution does not exchange the values
   referenced by t and u, the program is ill-formed; no diagnostic required.
   2) Otherwise, (void)ranges::swap_ranges(t, u), if T and U are lvalue references to
   array types of equal extent (but possibly different element types) and
   ranges::swap(*t, *u) is a valid expression;
   3) Otherwise, if T and U are both V& for some type V that meets the syntactic
   requirements of MoveConstructible<V> and Assignable<V&, V>, exchanges the referenced
   values as if by V v{std::move(t)}; t = std::move(u); u = std::move(v);. If the
   semantic requirements of either concept are not satisfied, the program is
   ill-formed; no diagnostic required.
   4) In all other cases, a call to ranges::swap is ill-formed.

   ranges::swap can be used in a constant expression if every function it calls (as
   specified above) can be so used.

.SH Exceptions

   1)
   noexcept specification:  
   noexcept(noexcept((void)swap(std::forward<T>(t), std::forward<T>(u))))
   , where swap is found as described above.
   2)
   noexcept specification:  
   noexcept(noexcept(ranges::swap(*t, *u)))
   3)
   noexcept specification:  
   noexcept(std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<V> &&
            std::is_nothrow_move_assignable_v<V>)
