.SH NAME
std::coroutine_handle::destroy \- std::coroutine_handle::destroy

.SH Synopsis
   Member of other specializations
   void destroy() const;                                                    \fB(1)\fP (since
                                                                                C++20)
   Member of specialization
   std::coroutine_handle<std::noop_coroutine_promise>
   constexpr void destroy() const noexcept;                                 \fB(2)\fP (since
                                                                                C++20)

   1) Destroys the coroutine state of the coroutine to which *this refers, or does
   nothing if the coroutine is a no-op coroutine.
   2) Does nothing.

   The behavior is undefined if destroying is needed and *this does not refer a
   suspended coroutine.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Notes

   N4861 (C++20 final working draft) requires that a call to destroy on a
   std::coroutine_handle<> converted from a std::noop_coroutine_handle is also no-op,
   which is unimplementable because a std::noop_coroutine_handle may refer to a
   coroutine that is not no-op, or may not refer to a coroutine. This is LWG issue
   3460.
