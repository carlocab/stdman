.SH NAME
std::signed_integral \- std::signed_integral

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <concepts>
   template < class T >                                                \fI(since C++20)\fP
   concept signed_integral = std::integral<T> && std::is_signed_v<T>;

   The concept signed_integral<T> is satisfied if and only if T is an integral type and
   std::is_signed_v<T> is true.

.SH Notes

   signed_integral<T> may be satisfied by a type that is not a signed integer type, for
   example, char (on a system where char is signed).
