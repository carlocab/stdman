.SH NAME
std::tuple_size<std::experimental::ranges::tagged> \- std::tuple_size<std::experimental::ranges::tagged>

.SH Synopsis
   template< class Base, class... Tags >

   struct tuple_size<std::experimental::ranges::tagged<Base, Tags...>>  (ranges TS)

   : std::tuple_size<Base> { };

   The partial specialization of std::tuple_size for tagged provides the ability to
   obtain the number of elements in a tagged object using tuple-like syntax. It simply
   forwards to std::tuple_size<Base>.

Inherited from std::integral_constant
