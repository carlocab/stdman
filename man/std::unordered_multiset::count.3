.SH NAME
std::unordered_multiset::count \- std::unordered_multiset::count

.SH Synopsis
   size_type count( const Key& key ) const; \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   template< class K >                      \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP
   size_type count( const K& x ) const;

   1) Returns the number of elements with key that compares equal to the specified
   argument key.
   2) Returns the number of elements with key that compares equivalent to the specified
   argument x. This overload only participates in overload resolution if
   Hash::is_transparent and KeyEqual::is_transparent are valid and each denotes a type.
   This assumes that such Hash is callable with both K and Key type, and that the
   KeyEqual is transparent, which, together, allows calling this function without
   constructing an instance of Key.

.SH Parameters

   key - key value of the elements to count
   x   - a value of any type that can be transparently compared with a key

.SH Return value

   1) Number of elements with key key.
   2) Number of elements with key that compares equivalent to x.

.SH Complexity

   linear in the number of elements with key key on average, worst case linear in the
   size of the container.
